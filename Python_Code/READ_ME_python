# This file contains the Python code used to generate the PHATE plots for the individual NBA seasons. 

# The user must note that the initial season tables read in for these plots consist of the player rows for a given season and their 21 scaled statistics for that season.
# Row names indicating the player, team, and year have been excluded from these tables. The user may read in the new9_smpXXXX.csv files and simply exclude the first 
# column to achieve the same outcome as the one presented in this code.
